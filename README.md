# Customer Churn Prediction Project
![customer_churn](customer_churn.png)
## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a business or service. It is a critical challenge for companies across various industries, including banking. Being able to predict customer churn can provide valuable insights to companies, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

In this Jupyter notebook project, we will explore a dataset called "Bank Customer Churn Prediction." This dataset contains information about bank customers and their characteristics, such as credit score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, and more. We will leverage this dataset to build a predictive model that can identify potential churners.

The project will be divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: We will begin by loading the dataset into our notebook and gaining an understanding of its structure and content. We will explore the different variables, check for missing values, and perform any necessary data cleaning steps.

2. **Data Visualization**: Visualizations can provide valuable insights into the relationships between different variables and help identify patterns and trends. We will create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to explore the data further.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training a predictive model, we need to preprocess the data. This step involves handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: We will select a suitable machine learning algorithm and train it on the preprocessed data. We will evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and make any necessary adjustments to improve its predictive capabilities.

5. **Customer Churn Prediction**: Using the trained model, we will make churn predictions on new, unseen data. We will discuss the importance of interpretability and explore methods to interpret the model's predictions.

By the end of this project, you will have gained hands-on experience in reading, cleaning, visualizing, and predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. So, let's get started!
